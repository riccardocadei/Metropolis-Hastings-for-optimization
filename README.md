- [ ] handle the overflow warning that appears sometimes ?
- [ ] report: properly explain our implementation, and answer the questions
- [ ] compare naive implementation with our optimization
- [ ] change docstring to talk only about f, not g
- [ ] script run.py for competition
- [ ] have a nice notebook
- [ ] pre compute matrix of distances
