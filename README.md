Deploying a 5G Network in a country

# What still needs to be done in the project

- [x] write functions for the plots
- [x] optimize delta
- [x] memorize the best
- [x] pre compute matrix of distances (still to do some debugging in the comments)
- [x] nice python files (Anita)
- [ ] docstring (Anita)
- [ ] compare starting state (Riccardo)
- [ ] benchmarking of parameters : range of beta, n_iter, for different models (Anita)
- [ ] have a nice notebook (Riccardo)

- [ ] handle the overflow warning that appears sometimes ?
- [ ] report: properly explain our implementation, and answer the questions
- [ ] compare naive implementation with our optimization (we optimize the time mostly ? not sure)
- [x] change docstring to talk only about f, not g
- [ ] script run.py for competition
